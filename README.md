Forecasting Belgian Property Prices with CatBoost and MAPIE!
==============================

This app is designed to predict house prices in Belgium using data collected from [immoweb.be](https://www.immoweb.be/en), a prominent real
estate platform in the country. By employing a CatBoost model in conjunction with MAPIE, our goal is to provide precise and up-to-date price forecasts, along with an estimation of uncertainty based on conformal prediction.
Explore the current housing market, gain insights into the key determinants of property prices, and put our prediction tool to the test.
