        Welcome to the **Belgian House Price Predictor**! This app is designed to predict house prices in Belgium using data collected from [immoweb.be](https://www.immoweb.be/en), a prominent real estate platform in the country. By employing a `CatBoost model` in conjunction with `MAPIE`, our goal is to provide precise and up-to-date price forecasts, along with an estimation of uncertainty based on *conformal prediction*.

        "How often is the model updated?": "Our pipeline runs monthly via GitHub actions to keep the model and dataset current.",
        "What's planned for future updates?": "We are exploring the inclusion of advertisement time to account for seasonality in the model and faster data scraping techniques. Stay tuned for updates!",
        "How does the data pipeline work?": {
            "text": "Our data processing pipeline adheres to the traditional *Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)* process. Initially, we extract data from the source using the `requests-html` library. Following this, we execute multiple steps to refine the raw data, encompassing datatype conversions from strings to numerical values and converting low cardinal numerical data to boolean. Once our data is prepared, we perform the essential step of splitting it into train and test sets. This step ensures an unbiased model performance evaluation later on. It's worth noting that during the project's experimental phases, we evaluated various ML algorithms, including `decision trees`, `XGBoost`, and more. After rigorous experimentation, we selected `Catboost` due to its exceptional overall performance. Upon loading our pre-defined and optimized hyperparameters, we are fully equipped to train and subsequently assess the model's performance using the test set. The results of the model's performance are saved for reference. This entire pipeline is initiated on a monthly basis through GitHub actions, ensuring that both our model and dataset remain up-to-date.",
