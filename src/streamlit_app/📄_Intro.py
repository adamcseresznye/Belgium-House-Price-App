        This app is designed to predict house prices in Belgium using data gathered from [immoweb.be](https://www.immoweb.be/en), a prominent real
        estate platform in the country. Leveraging a CatBoost model with MAPIE, we aim to offer accurate and current price predictions with prediction intervals based on conformal prediction.

        This is version 2 of our app, completely redesigned from the ground up.

        **What has changed:**
        - Data that has been scraped and sanitized is now directly uploaded to our MongoDB database.
        - The unnecessary features have been eliminated.
        - Automatic feature selection is included with hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.
        - Predictions are made with confidence intervals at the 90% level, utilizing conformal prediction.
